# Netflix-Subscriptions-Forecasting
Forecasting the number of subscriptions Netflix will achieve in a time period is a vital business practice that enables them to plan, strategize, and make data-driven decisions. It enhances operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy. 
# Intriduction
Using techniques like time series forecasting, Netflix can estimate the expected number of new subscribers in a given time period and better understand the growth potential of their business. Below is the process we can follow to forecast subscription counts for Netflix:
1. Gather historical Netflix subscriptions growth data
2. Preprocess and clean the data
3. Explore and analyze time series patterns
4. Choose a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
5. Train the model using the training data
6. Forecast future Netflix subscription counts

# Features
You are provided with a dataset to build a forecasting model that accurately predicts the future quarterly subscriptions for Netflix. Below are the features in the dataset:
1. Time Period: Quarterly time period
2. Subscribers: Number of subscribers at the end of each quarter

# Conclusion
Here we first calculated the differenced time series from the original time_series, removed any NaN values resulting from the differencing, and then plotted the ACF and PACF to provide insights into the potential order of the AR and MA components in the time series. These plots are useful for determining the appropriate parameters when using the ARIMA model for time series forecasting. Based on the plots, we find that p=1 and q=1. The ACF plot cuts off at lag 1, indicating q=1, and the PACF plot also cuts off at lag 1, indicating p=1. As there is a linear trend in the subscription growth rate, we can set the value of d as 1 to remove the linear trend, making the time series stationary. Using techniques like time series forecasting, Netflix can estimate the expected number of new subscribers in a given time period and better understand the growth potential of their business. It enhances operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy, ultimately contributing to their success and growth in the highly competitive streaming industry.
